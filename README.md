### Build The program

1. cd src
2. mkdir build
3. cd build
4. cmake ../..
5. make -j 5
6. ./TheKnightProblem ../../inputs/input1.txt ../../inputs/result1.txt


### ISSUES
A. Honestly, I've never searching the internet for algorithms to solve this problem. Your company values my creativity and coding skills, and all the solutions are a product of my own ideas. If you come across any issues with the design or anything else, it's a reflection of my abilities.

B. I acknowledge that there are several to-dos on my list, and I'm aware of their existence. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I haven't been able to address them yet. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

C. For this problem I can write good interfaces for these algorithms and solve all of them without changing the implementation. for example 8-queen and any backtracking algorithms as same as these.

D. Thank you for this opportunity. :D

Good luck.
